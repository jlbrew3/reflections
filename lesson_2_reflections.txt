What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Does not create an initial commit but prepares you to.
Commands:
git init - from within appropriate directory
git status - to check on status and see what is being tracked/has changed

Staging area - adding and removing
git add FILE NAME
git reset FILE NAME

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Allows you to mix and match files without formally committing them
Gives you essentially a second chance to check your work before committing
